## This is a final project in NYU course Real-time Embedded System
### Name: "Embedded Sentry"
### Objectives: 
* Use the data collected from a single accelerometer and/or magnetometer to record a hand movement sequence as a means to generally “unlock” a resource.
* Recorded sequence must be saved on the microcontroller, using a “Record Key” feature.
* User then must replicate the key sequence within sufficient tolerances to unlock the resource. 
* A successful unlock must be indicated by a visual indication, such as an LED or similar indicator.
